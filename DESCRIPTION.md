# Crash Course: Intro to Java

Have you ever wondered about what makes your Android device work? Would it surprise you to know that the same tech powers giants like Amazon, Google, and Twitter? Curious?

This [_Intro to Java_ Crash Course](http://github.com/2016-03-15--intro-to-java) from [The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com) is just for _you!_ Together, we'll explore [the most popular programming language in the world](http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe_index): Java! We'll talk about:

* What is programming, anyway?
* What is Java? What makes it so special?
* How do I build programs with Java?
* What kind of programs can I build?
* Who uses programs built in Java?

We don't assume that you have any previous knowledge of Java... or any other programming language, for that matter. For the first part of the course, we'll talk about some of the concepts behind Java programming, then we'll build a simple program together to explore those concepts.

**Important:** To follow along with your _own_ computer during the class, you'll only need a computer with [Google Chrome](http://google.com/chrome/) and WiFi. We'll use [an online code editor called _Cloud 9_](http://c9.io) to write and run our code.
