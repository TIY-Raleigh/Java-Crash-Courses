# What is Java?

### A highly-portable, object-oriented, C-type programming environment with broad adoption across a wide range of platforms.

# What is Java?

### A _highly-portable_[^1], object-oriented, C-type programming environment with broad adoption across a wide range of platforms.

[^1]: [_Software Portability_ on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_portability)

^ One of the hallmarks of Java is its _portability_: you can run the same (or very similar) Java code on almost any device that can run the _Java Virtual Machine_ or _JVM_.

### A highly-portable, _object-oriented_[^1], C-type programming environment with broad adoption across a wide range of platforms.

[^1]: [_Object-Oriented Programming_ on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)

^ Java was purposefully built to follow a specific _style_ of programming called _object-oriented programming_.
^ The basic premise of object-oriented programming is to try to model real-world systems and processes using the _same terms_ used in the real-world.

# What is Java?

### A highly-portable, object-oriented, _C-type_ programming environment with broad adoption across a wide range of platforms.

^ Java is considered a _C-type_ language: it follows the basic rules of the C programming language. Curly braces and semicolons are important, among other things.
^ Other notable C-type languages you might have heard of are JavaScript, PHP, C# (C-Sharp), and Swift (iOS).

# What is Java?

### A highly-portable, object-oriented, C-type _programming environment_ with broad adoption across a wide range of platforms.

^ To be fair, Java is more than just a programming _language_, it comprises an entire environment: the core language, a _very large_ standard library, a _virtual machine_ that your code runs in, and supplemental programs.
^ In addition, there are entire dialects of Java specific to certain platforms -- Android, for example -- and _other programming languages_ built for the JVM like Scala and Clojure.

### A highly-portable, object-oriented, C-type programming environment with _broad adoption_[^1] across a wide range of platforms.

[^1]: [TIOBE Index of Popular Programming Languages](http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe_index)

^ By "broad adoption", we mean the number of products that employ Java as the primary development language. _One_ useful measure is the TIOBE index published monthly since 2003.

# What is Java?

### A highly-portable, object-oriented, C-type programming environment with broad adoption across a _wide range of platforms_.

^ Because of all these reasons, Java code is deployed to more platforms and devices than practically any other programming language behind C and C++.
^ Consider that Java and the JVM power Android phones and tablets, which are manufactured by hundreds of vendors in thousands of configurations.
